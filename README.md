# Movies-ETL

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to refactor code to create an automated extract-transform-load(ETL) process. The code takes in new data, transforms the data into usable information, and then loads the data into tables that can be queried by other users. This code can be run on a daily, weekly, or at will basis to keep the data up to date with the most recent information. The code is used to feed updated data to Amazing Prime from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens.
